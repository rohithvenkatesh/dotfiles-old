For example, when hovering over the left or right edge, drag vertically instead of horizontally.\n\n### Windows\n\nIf you use Windows and know how to move the window without the top bar, please let us know so we can add it here. :) Simply comment on [the issue about it](https://github.com/jancborchardt/hyperminimal/issues/12).\n\n## Other recommended plugins\n\n- [hyper-dark-scrollbar](https://github.com/moso/hyper-dark-scrollbar)\n- [hypercwd](https://github.com/hharnisc/hypercwd)\n- [hyper-blink](https://github.com/amio/hyper-blink)\n- [hyperterm-alternatescroll](https://github.com/lkzhao/hyperterm-alternatescroll)\n- [hyperterm-one-light](https://github.com/andrepolischuk/hyper-one-light/)\n- [hyperborder](https://github.com/webmatze/hyperborder)\n",
